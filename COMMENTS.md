### Comments

- The current implementation is using functional React components, MUI and custom CSS classes.
- The goal was to stay as close as possible to the structure of data presented initially, but enhance design, user experience and responsiveness.
- One of the challenges included dealing with unstable data coming from API. To make sure that this doesn't affect the frontend I decided to use default images and default links that are only used if API data returns faulty values.

### Future steps
Without any restrictions regarding time and API calls the current user experience could be enhanced through:
- implementing search and filtering functionality
- implementing modals with additional information and embedded videos
- implementing a more interactive and creative design concept
